###Abstract

Traditional methods of attendance monitoring, such as manual roll calls and paper-based sign-ins, RFID card sign-ins, are of-ten time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient in large-scale set-tings. These methods can lead to inaccuracies in attendance records, false attendances, administrative burdens, and confusion among stu-dents regarding the recording of their attendance. The need for a more efficient, accurate, and reliable attendance management system is evi-dent, especially in educational institutions and organizations where ac-curate attendance records are crucial. Our paper presents a revolution-ary approach to attendance tracking by integrating facial recognition technology with advanced software systems and well optimized for enhanced accuracy. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, Paper offers a solution that enhances ac-curacy and efficiency in attendance management. The system utilizes camera modules and a meticulously trained deep learning model to capture facial data, process images, and match faces with a compre-hensive database. Paper functions by seamlessly capturing and analyz-ing images, accurately identifying individuals, and automatically log-ging attendance data. This automation not only significantly reduces manual effort and improves overall accuracy, leading to streamlined administrative workflows and enhanced data accessibility, but also re-duces the confusion and doubt among students regarding whether their attendance has been actually recorded.
